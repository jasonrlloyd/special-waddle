Draw your finished car when it rolls off the line! Add racing stripes, rocket boosters — whatever you imagine!\n\nLook at that teamwork! You’ve just built a car the Henry Ford way — one small step at a time.\n\n🦉🚘 And remember… when something feels tricky, try breaking it into smaller pieces.\n\nYou might be surprised at what you can build.\n\nSee you next time, little inventor!"

Spin, stomp, wiggle, strike a power pose — there’s no wrong way to move when you’re dancing with confidence.\n\n👉 Add your own flair! Maybe it’s a sparkly outfit, a hairbrush microphone, or some jazzy socks. 💃🧦\n\nAnd at the end of your dance…\n\n👉 Bow like a star and say:\n\n“I am strong. I am joyful. I was born to shine!”\n\n🎤 Just like Beyoncé, your voice matters. Your moves matter. You matter.\n\nSo sing loud, dance proud, and don’t forget…\n\nThe spotlight’s already inside you. Let it shine. 🦉💫🎤\n\nSee you next time, superstar!"
